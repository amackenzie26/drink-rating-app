# drink-rating-app

For this project we used HTML, CSS, Javascript, existing third-party API’s and server side API’s to create an app with a dynamic user interface. We researched and utilized a variety of technologies (listed below) in order to make the app interactive, purposeful and asthetically pleasing. We embraced a collaborative approach to the creation of this app by using pair programming. We maintained an organized task flow by utilizing Github's project cards, issue submissions and branch protection rules so that we could review and approve updates to the app.

## App Overview

This app will allow a user to input or “check-in” a mixed-drink as they enjoy it.  They will then be able to rate that drink (out of 5 stars).  After submitting their rating, they will also be presented with personalized recommendations.  They will receive a recommendation for a different drink they may enjoy, based on the rating they provided. They will also see a list of 3 nearby venues so they can “keep the party going” and try a new selection.

## User Stories

## Future Developments

This data will be saved in their dashboard and sorted in descending order: from favorite drinks (5 stars) shown first to less-enjoyable (1 star) drinks.
