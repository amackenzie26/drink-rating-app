# drink-rating-app

Project 1 :

What: For this project we will be using HTML, CSS, Javascript, existing third-party API’s and server side API’s to create an app with a dynamic user interface. This app will allow users to try a drink at a specific location, rate that drink, provide their location, and will provide nearby venue and similar drink suggestions.

How:

Wireframe: This will show the structure of our application page before we start writing code.

The user will need to turn on location sharing and will share their location. Use an alert and get back lat and lon data based on their IP address. If they decline they will have to enter manually and will need location auto populate city. 

The user will have an input form in which the enter their drink name or drink ingrediant. A list will auto-populate, and the user will select their current drink.

This input will populate a list of drinks and the user will select their current drink. 

The user will give a drink rating. Rating stored locally has a date, and expires in 24 hours. 

Low rating will not pupulate same ingrediant of current drink. 

*Two Columns will populate*

First column: A list of nearby venues (bars, liquer stores, restuaraunts) will populate. 

Second column: One suggest (featured) drink suggestion based on their rating. 

Persistant Data: Local Storage
